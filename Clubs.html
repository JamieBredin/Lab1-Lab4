                <p> Cricket is a sport that can be played both competitively for regular players, and non competitively for new players. Taking everyone's skills into account, the games rhythm can be set so as to make it most enjoyable for everyone involved regardless of skill. Students learn the importance of teamwork and good sportsmanship while playing a sport they love!</p>

         <h2>Fencing</h2>
                <p>Sligo IT fencing is Sligo IT's one and only fencing club for both beginners and advanced fencers!
                Even if you are curious about mastering the sword and unsure if you start I recommend you take a stab at this fantastic sport.
                SligoITFC primarily trains in épée fencing, the best type. </p>
